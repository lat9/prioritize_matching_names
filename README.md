# Prioritize Matching Names on Search
 <p>The default &quot;search&quot; keyword-matching gives equal weight to matches found in a product's name, model number and manufacturer's name, as well as those matches found in a product's meta-tags and meta-tag descriptions.  Equal weight is also given to matches found in a product's description (if the <em>Search in Product Descriptions</em> box is checked).</p>
  <p>This plugin makes a slight update to the processing, giving priority (i.e. they're displayed first) to those matches found in a <em>product's name</em>.  The plugin requires Zen Cart v1.5.8a or later and a PHP version 7.0 or later for its proper operation.</p>
